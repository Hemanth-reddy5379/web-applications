<h1>Sucess Stories</h1>

<h2>MRS. KAVITA KUMARI & DR. PREM KUMAR</h2>
<p>Born to a government employee in Delhi, my childhood was comparatively good as I was admitted to one of the best schools of the city. But one cannot guarantee of same level throughout life. Financial crunches arose and I had to drop my studies in my adolescent age. Inadequate education caused troubles in my career. I started my career merely for Rs 1100 pm. Then I did a computer course and I started drawing Rs 3000 per month. Feelings of instability were engrossing me so I set up a small scale business that too collapsed. In 2007, I met a dynamic personality named Mr. Satyan Bhatia who introduced me to IMC Business. I would say it was my bad luck that I did not take IMC Business seriously. After a long gap, I was invited by Mr. Satyan Bhatia to be a part of Trade Fair where I got inspiration and started taking IMC Business in a serious manner. Afterwards there was no looking back. I started achieving levels in a swift mode. Now I feel proud to be Kohinoor Crown President Associate. My economic condition is strengthened only because of IMC Business.</p>
<h2>MRS. LUXMI SHARMA & DR. AJAY KUMAR SHARMA</h2>
<p>If we talk about formal academic qualification, I am a law graduate. My parental family background was mediocre but my dreams were always high. I always wanted to lead life of financial independence. This feeling pushed me towards resigning the job and setting up own business. I listened to my mind and opened a shop. Alike my parents I was also living a middle class life. Mr. Jasvir Singh, one of my good friends told me about IMC Business which is free from constraints like investment, education, regional boundaries etc. I joined IMC Business and got positive encouragement from Dr. Ashok Bhatia and Mr. Satyan Bhatia. An incident rather an accident influenced my thoughts. In 2014, myself and my IMC team members met with accident and all of us were on bed rest for 3-4 months. Surprisingly our income remained unaffected. It's magnificent merit of IMC Business. Now I am enjoying the level of Kohinoor Crown President Associate with recognition, fame and wealth.

<h2>MRS. REENA DEVI OJHA & MR. VED PRAKASH OJHA</h2>
<p>Born to a humble father who was a Gram Sewak in Gopalganj, a small village in Bihar, I saw hardships of life in tender age. Those hardships made me a person of determination and hardwork. Hardships did not come to an end, they increased when I lost my father at the age of seven. I left for Surat, Gujarat to work in a textile mill as a worker. Slowly & steadily I accumulated courage to open a petty grocery shop. I was happy that now I was known as a shopkeeper not as a worker but there was just a little improvement in earnings. One fine day, Mr. Hari Prasad Sharma, one of my old friends came to my shop with IMC Shri Tulsi. Influenced by its results, I decided to join IMC Business. God showered His blessings as a meeting with Mr. Satyan Bhatia in a seminar. His words encouraged me a lot and I started taking IMC Business as a passion. Once my wife had to sell out her gold jewellery so I had a target to bring back the jewellery. I worked hard and achieved the Silver level within a month. With four months, I was at the level of Diamond. Just in six months, I achieved the level of Chairman. Now I am enjoying the level of Kohinoor Crown President having luxurious cars like Mercedes Benz.
